# CrimeMapperiOS
This is [a simple iOS application](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/crime-mapper-uk/id1215749906?mt=8&at=11ltUj) written in Swift3 for downloading and displaying crime report data from the UK Police. See https://data.police.uk/ for API documentation

The app is just a proof-of-concept / learning experience for the moment. See the *issues* tab for my to-do list.
The 3rd party libraries I'm using are

- Dependency management [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
- Networking [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
- JSON Parsing [HandyJSON](https://github.com/alibaba/HandyJSON)
- Custom date popup helper [ActionSheetPicker](https://github.com/skywinder/ActionSheetPicker-3.0)
